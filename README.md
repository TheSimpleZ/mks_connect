# MKS Connect

This is going to be a android/ios/web app that will allow you to connect to Makerbase (MSK) based 3D printers.
It's currently under heavy development and is not ready for use.

The app is being tested with a Wanhao D12/230 printer. However, the ambition is for it to work with any MKS based printer.

The protocol used by the MKS can be found here: https://github.com/Jeredian/mks-wifi-plugin/blob/1.4.1/MKSOutputDevice.py
